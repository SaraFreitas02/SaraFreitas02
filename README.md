## Hi, I am Sara!

I am a `Junior Full-Stack` developer based in `The Netherlands` that loves the full control that traditional development allows. However, I also have a strong affinity for **ReactJS** and plan to expand my skills to Angular and NextJS in the future.

On the backend, **NodeJS** is my go to, and I have a good understanding of **JSON**. When it comes to databases, my favorite is **MongoDB**.

I enjoy experimenting with different frameworks and libraries, such as **jQuery**, **Express**, **Dotenv** and **Font Awesome**.

**Git** and **GitHub** are my favorite version control tools (_surprise..._) and, while **Visual Studio Code** is my primary code editor, I have worked a bit on Android Studio as well.

I currently code on Windows, but I am super open to trying Linux and IOS.

## Journey and Goals

I am a self-taught developer on a journey to break into the tech industry.

To bring more structure to my learning, I have completed a *Web Development* course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) and am currently following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I regularly challenge myself with algorithmic problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) to strengthen my JavaScript skills.

I am continuously building projects to apply my knowledge, and I am currently working on a private project that will soon go live with its own domain.

<br>

### Why self-taught?
I chose the self-taught path because I believe development and programming are skills that thrive on hands-on practice. 

I have supplemented my learning with structured resources like The Odin Project and LeetCode, and I believe that my growing portfolio will serve as proof of my abilities.

<br>

### 2025 Goals 

**Main Goal**: Build a Strong Portfolio ‚Äì <u>Deadline</u>: July 2025

1. Complete My Private Project (Launching soon with its own domain)
2. Complete The Odin Project while turning assignments into real-world mockup projects
3. Develop and Publish My Portfolio Website
