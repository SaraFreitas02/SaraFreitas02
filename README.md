## Goals
My main goal is to become a full-stack developer, but my back-end skills are still being refined. I currently have a stronger foundation in front-end development, so I consider myself more of a front-end developer at this stage. Right now, I am focused on building a solid knowledge base, after which I plan to set challenging projects to further encourage my growth.
<br>
I have an ongoing project in my repositories, [**Venusya Store**](https://github.com/SaraFreitas02/Venusya), but this is on hold while I continue deepening my knowledge and exploring my preferences. However, it is in my goal list to finish it in the near future.
