# Hello, I'm Sara 👋

I'm a self-taught web developer and programmer based in *The Netherlands*. I'm passionate about coding, and I'm constantly learning and building projects to improve my skills.

## 🔧 Skills & Tools

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (always improving)
- Git & GitHub
- Visual Studio Code
- ...and always eager to learn more!

## 🚀 Projects
The projects I have completed at the moment are simple in nature, serving the purpose of practice and exploration of various features within HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I plan to continue working on more of such projects, with a concurrent aspiration to embark on larger and more complex endeavors.

- [Simple Language Selector](https://github.com/SaraFreitas02/LanguageSelector.js-practice):  It features a basic language-switching function that allows users to choose between the English and Portuguese language by selcting the respective option on the selection feature.
- [Simple Language Switcher](https://sarafreitas02.github.io/LanguageSwitcher.js-practice/): It features a basic language-switching function that allows users to toggle between English and Portuguese greetings by clicking corresponding buttons..
- [Number Changer](https://sarafreitas02.github.io/NumberChanger.js-practice/): It provides a basic interface that allows users to choose a number and increase or decrease it with the click of buttons..

## 🌱 Goals

I'm currently working on a [Vet Registration Form](https://sarafreitas02.github.io/Vet-Registration-Form/). 

My objective is to develop a streamlined yet dynamic veterinary clinic registration form. This form will empower clients to effortlessly register vital information about their pets while also facilitating the creation of user accounts. This dual-purpose approach aims to enhance operational efficiency for the veterinary clinic and provide a user-friendly, practical experience for clients.
I am engaged in an ongoing learning process, and I anticipate that this project, being the most complex one I have undertaken thus far, may require a substantial amount of time. Nevertheless, through continuous practice and experience, I am confident that I will be able to set more efficient timelines and achieve quicker project completion in the future.
