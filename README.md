## ðŸŒ± Goals

I'm currently working on a [Vet Registration Form](https://sarafreitas02.github.io/Vet-Registration-Form/). 

My objective is to develop a streamlined yet dynamic veterinary clinic registration form. This form will empower clients to effortlessly register vital information about their pets while also facilitating the creation of user accounts. This dual-purpose approach aims to enhance operational efficiency for the veterinary clinic and provide a user-friendly, practical experience for clients.
I am engaged in an ongoing learning process, and I anticipate that this project, being the most complex one I have undertaken thus far, may require a substantial amount of time. Nevertheless, through continuous practice and experience, I am confident that I will be able to set more efficient timelines and achieve quicker project completion in the future.
