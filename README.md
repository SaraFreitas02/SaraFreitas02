# Hello, I'm Sara ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught web developer and programmer based in *The Netherlands*. I'm passionate about coding, and I'm constantly learning and building projects to improve my skills.

## ðŸ”§ Skills & Tools

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (always improving)
- Git & GitHub
- Visual Studio Code
- ...and always eager to learn more!

## ðŸš€ Projects
The projects I have completed at the moment are simple in nature, serving the purpose of practice and exploration of various features within HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some examples are:

- [Number Changer](https://sarafreitas02.github.io/NumberChanger.js-practice/): It provides a basic interface that allows users to choose a number and increase or decrease it with the click of buttons.
- [Radio Button Message Generator](https://sarafreitas02.github.io/RadioBtnMsgGen.js-practice/): It is a JavaScript exploration, enabling dynamic messaging through radio button choices.
- [Guess the Number Game](https://sarafreitas02.github.io/NumGuessGame/): It showcases a simple yet entertaining number-guessing game.

 I plan to continue working on more of such projects, with a concurrent aspiration to embark on larger and more complex endeavors. 
## ðŸŒ± Goals

I'm currently working on a [Vet Registration Form](https://sarafreitas02.github.io/Vet-Registration-Form/). 

My objective is to develop a streamlined yet dynamic veterinary clinic registration form. This form will empower clients to effortlessly register vital information about their pets while also facilitating the creation of user accounts. This dual-purpose approach aims to enhance operational efficiency for the veterinary clinic and provide a user-friendly, practical experience for clients.
I am engaged in an ongoing learning process, and I anticipate that this project, being the most complex one I have undertaken thus far, may require a substantial amount of time. Nevertheless, through continuous practice and experience, I am confident that I will be able to set more efficient timelines and achieve quicker project completion in the future.
