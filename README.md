## Goals
My main goal is to become a full-stack developer, though I‚Äôm currently refining my backend skills. With a stronger foundation in frontend development, I primarily identify as a frontend developer at this stage. However, I‚Äôm keen on expanding my programming skills and exploring mobile app and game development.

Right now, my focus is on building a solid knowledge base, and I‚Äôm excited to take on challenging projects that push me further and foster my growth.
